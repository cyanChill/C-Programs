# Information

This branch contains 5 files which I started to learn more about the Process Management System Calls (specifically, the `exec` family of functions).

| File            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `execl_date.c`  | This file is to demonstrate how we can use `execl` to show the date and time in Unix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `execp_ls.c`    | This file is to demonstrate how we can use `exevp` to show all files (including hidden files) in a directory with information such as permissions, owner, size, and when it was last modified (so essentially `ls -la`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `Prcs_P1.c`     | This creates 2 files, `destination1.txt` and `destination2.txt` with read, write, and execute permissions. This is one of the 2 files which we'll use an `exec` command to run in a child process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Prcs_P2.c`     | This copies the contents of `source.txt` into `destination1.txt` & `destination2.txt` with the following procedure:<br>1. Read the next 100 characters from `source.txt` and among the characters read, replace each character '1' with 'L' and write this into `destination1.txt`<br>2. Read the next 50 characters from `source.txt` and among the characters read, replace each character '3' with 'E' and write this into `destination2.txt` |
| `Parent_Prcs.c` | This file creates a child process to execute `Prcs_P1`, then after this finishes, we make another child to execute `Prcs_P2`. <br><br>Use: `./<exename> <Prcs_P1 exename> <Prcs_P2 exename>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

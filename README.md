# Information

This branch contains 4 files which I learned about Process Management System calls. I learned a bit about:
- Process Creation
- Forking
- Piping

| File              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `children.c`      | This file is me learning about how we can create 2 child processes within a single parent process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `forkProcesses.c` | This program is us familiarizing the behavior of forking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `series.c`        | This is a file where we input a positive integer number and:<br>- In one process, get the sum of a series of all the even numbers (from 0 to the inputted number)<br>- In another process, get the sum of a series of all odd numbers (from 0 to the inputted number)<br><br>In addition, we pass the data from these child processes to the parent process (using piping) and print the result of the sum of the 2 series.<br><br>Use: `./<exename> <positive integer>` |
| `readwritePipe.c` | With this file, we want to open a file & read its content in a child process, and write that data (which we pass from the child process to the parent process) to another file while in the parent process.<br><br>Use: `./<exename> <source filename> <destination filename>`                                                                                                                                                                                           |

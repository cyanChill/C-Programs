# Information

This branch contains 3 files which I expanded my knowledge of semaphores & mutexes and in addition, learned about threads.

| File            | Description        |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| `smoker_sem.c`  | This contains the solution of the [smoker problem](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hollings/cs412/s96/synch/smokers.html) (finite number of cigarettes created) using semaphores & mutexes [problem can be found in the report]. |
| `smoker_pthread.c`  | This is the solution to the smoker problem (finite number of cigarettes created) using threads w/ the pthread library. |
| `sem.h`    | This file was provided and for us to be able to make semaphores & mutexes. |

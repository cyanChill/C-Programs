# Information

This branch contains 2 files which I utilized processes to write a simple command interpreter and an average grade calculator that utilizes processes.
- Overall, these were very interesting tasks to do

| `interpreter.c`    | This is a simple command interpreter where we can run commands (that doesn't contain strings & up to a single pipe).                                                                |
| `avg_grade_calc.c` | This is a simple average grade calculator. Essentially, we input the name of the text file containing the grades (tab-separated values).<br><br>Use: `./<exename> <grade filename>` |
